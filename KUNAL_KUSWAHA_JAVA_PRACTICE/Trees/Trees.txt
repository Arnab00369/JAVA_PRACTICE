Types::
1) Binary Trees:
==> Maximum of 2 children

2) Complete Binary Trees:
    ==> All levels should be filled of 2 children and last level should be filled from left to right

3) Full/ Strict Binary Trees:
==> Every node either 0 or 2 children (***strict)

Use cases: comression/ segment trees


4) Perfect Binary Trees:
==> All levels are full

5) Height Balanced Trees:
==> Average height O(log n)

6) Skewed Binary Trees:
==> Height: O(n), like linked-list

7) Ordered Binary Trees:
    Every node folows some property
    ==> Binary Search Trees::
        ===================
        => Left node - Smaller value
        => Right node - Larger value
