**Entry Point:** This is where execution starts,
 without this JVM does not know where to start running the code

 **Public and Static:**
 ==> 'public' to access anywhere
 ==> 'static' --> We can use program without being instatiating the class
                  or calling and creating objects

**Fixed Signature:**
public static void main(String args[])

==> Always use this, try not to deviate or change this particular code
